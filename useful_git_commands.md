```sh
git fetch && git rebase origin/<branch_name>
```

### ðŸ”€ If your excess commits are only visible to you, you can just you can use git reset to move back to where the origin is. Next command will reset the state of the repository to the previous commit, and it will discard all local changes.

```sh
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>

```sh
git reset --hard <branch_name>
```
